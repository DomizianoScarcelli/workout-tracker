## Application description 

Workout tracker is a web application whose purpose is to allow exercise tracking, whether they're done in a gym or a home.

The user can check the exercises that he has done on a certain day and can add details like the number of repetitions and the duration of the workout.

The user can also save a list of favorite workouts, where there will be a series of exercises, so he can add the same workout later without recreating it. 

The app can show some analytics about the user's workout for a certain period that the user can choose.
